					<p class="lead text-center">Singita, is the Shangaan word for ‘Place of Miracles’. In the spirit of miracles, Singita’s enduring purpose is to conserve, preserve, and protect the miraculous places of which we are custodians. Our concessions, reserves, and properties represent some of the most pristine wilderness areas on the continent and we are dedicated to maintaining these incredible pieces of earth for future generations.</p>

					<p>Singita has a firm commitment to the sustainability of each property by continuing to build upon three core pillars: wildlife conservation, eco-friendly tourism, and community support.</p>

					<p>“As a safari company, Singita differentiates itself in a philosophical way. Whereas the growth of many businesses worldwide is bottom line driven, Singita’s decisions take into account 20, 50 and even 100-year horizons,” says Singita’s CEO, Luke Bailes. “People feel privileged to stay in unpopulated, untouched wilderness areas and they choose to stay with us because our lodges have a reputation for being rare and authentic, while embodying a philosophy of sensitivity.” Adds Bailes, “there’s an authenticity of place at each of our lodges that is not only a rarity but touches guests on every level – spiritual, emotional and physical.”</p>

					<p>Your visit is sure to have a far reaching positive impact as it contributes to numerous conservation initiatives and community empowerment programs. These programs help to ensure a better future – not only for the land and the wildlife, but also for the local communities. In every sense, Singita is committed to facilitating the development of neighbouring rural populations through partnering with them on specific initiatives including education, healthcare, nutrition, training and business development. Modern conservation requires a keen focus on keeping tourism, the community and wildlife in a constructive balance. The health and survival of each of these aspects is crucial to the survival of the whole.</p>

					<p>Singita’s story began in 1925 when Luke Bailes’ grandfather purchased a piece of land in what would later become the Sabi Sand Reserve in South Africa. Situated in a remote corner of the Lowveld, the 45,000 acre reserve has evolved from its early days as a hunting concession to become an exclusive conservation reserve where all species are protected. Singita’s first lodge, Singita Ebony Lodge, opened its doors in 1993 in this magnificent piece of family land and the brand has been growing ever since. Today, Singita’s unique philosophy lives on in each of the twelve lodges and camps across five diverse ecosystems. Singita Sabi Sand and Singita Kruger National Park in South Africa are home to the magnificent lodges, Ebony, Boulders, Sweni and Lebombo, while a pristine patch of Zimbabwe, Singita Paumushana, houses a lodge by the same name. At Singita Grumeti in Tanzania, guests are spoiled for choice with Singita Faru Faru Lodge, Singita Sasakwa Lodge, Singita Sabora Tented Camp, Singita Explore and Singita Serengeti House, all located in the reserve, while the remote Lamai triangle offers Singita Mara River Tented Camp.</p>

					<p>For what the future holds, Singita’s founder and CEO, Luke Bailes asserts, “We will only develop new properties if they are better than, or as good as, those we already have.” It’s a disciplined approach, ensuring that Singita’s reputation is continually elevated and continues to deliver the best possible guest experience, while still benefiting the land and communities in which we are privileged to operate.</p>
